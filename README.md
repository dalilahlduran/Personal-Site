# Personal-Site
This repository is dedicated to my personal website.

In this repo, you will find 3 separate HTML pages and a shared CSS stylesheet that makes up my personal website. On the website, I have hyperlinked my github, as well as, my linkedin account. I have even included my resume that is being hosted on a separate sit.
